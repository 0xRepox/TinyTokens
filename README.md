# TinyTokens

TinyTokens is a blockchain-based micro-donation platform designed to enable users to donate small amounts to charities, social causes, or community projects. With the rise of decentralized finance and blockchain's transparency, TinyTokens takes advantage of Scroll's zk-rollup technology to provide minimal transaction fees. This low-cost structure makes it possible for users to donate amounts as small as $0.10, while still maintaining trust and transparency in how their contributions are used.

The platform provides a simple, global interface where donations are publicly visible on the blockchain, ensuring transparency while giving users the option to donate anonymously if they prefer. Additionally, TinyTokens offers a reward system where users can earn NFTs or other tokens for consistent giving, encouraging continuous participation.
